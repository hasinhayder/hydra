## Getting Started

It's super easy to get Hydra up and running.

First clone the project and change the directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hasinhayder/hydra.git
cd hydra
```

Then follow the process using either Docker or without Docker (simple).

### Without Docker (Simple)

1. Install the dependencies

```shell
composer install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Generate application key

```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Start the webserver

```shell
php artisan serve
```

That's mostly it! You have a fully running laravel installation with Sanctum, all configured.

### Using Docker & Laravel Sail

1. Install the dependencies

```shell
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the containers

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

4. Generate application key

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
```

To learn more about Sail, visit the [official Doc](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail).

## Database Migration and Seeding

Open your `.env` file and change the DATABASE options. You can start with SQLite by following these steps

1. Create a new SQLite database

```shell
touch database/hydra.sqlite
```

Or simply create a new file as **hydra.sqlite** inside your **database** folder.

2. You can run both migrations and seeders together by simply running the following command

```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

**OR** 


you can run them separately using the following commands

2. Run Migrations

```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

Now your database has essential tables for user and roles management.

3. Run Database Seeders

Run `db:seed`, and you have your first admin user, some essential roles in the roles table, and the relationship correctly setup.

```shell
php artisan db:seed
```

Please note that the default admin user is **admin@hydra.project** and the default password is **hydra**. You should create a new admin user before deploying to production and delete this default admin user. You can do that using the available Hydra user management API or any DB management tool.

## List of Default Routes

Here is a list of default routes. Run the following artisan command to see this list in your terminal.

```shell
php artisan route:list
```

![Hydra - List of Default Routes](https://res.cloudinary.com/roxlox/image/upload/v1653131647/hydra/default-routes-hydra_fgn9oh.webp)

## Default Roles

Hydra comes with these `super-admin`,`admin`,`editor`,`customer` & `user` roles out of the box. For details, open the roles table after database seeding, or open the laravel tinker and experiment with the `Role` model.

```shell
php artisan tinker
```

run the following command

```php
>>> Role::select(['id','slug','name'])->get()
//or
>>> Role::all(['id','name','slug'])
//or
>>> Role::all()
```

## Routes Documentation

Let's have a look at what Hydra has to offer. Before experimenting with the following API endpoints, run your Hydra project using `php artisan serve` command. For the next part of this documentation, we assumed that Hydra is listening at http://localhost:8000

### User Registration

You can make an `HTTP POST` call to create/register a new user to the following endpoint. Newly created users will have the `user` role by default.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart payload or a JSON payload like this.

```json
{
    "name":"Hydra User",
    "email":"user@hydra.project",
    "password":"Surprisingly A Good Password"
}
```

Voila! Your user has been created and is now ready to log in!

If this user already exists, then you will receive a 409 Response like this

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "user already exists"
}
```

### User Authentication/Login (Admin)

Remember Hydra comes with the default admin user? You can log in as an admin by making an HTTP POST call to the following route.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/login
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart or a JSON payload like this.

```json
{
    "email":"admin@hydra.project",
    "password":"hydra"
}
```

You will get a JSON response with user token. You need this admin token for making any call to other routes protected by admin ability.

```json
{
    "error": 0,
    "token": "1|se9wkPKTxevv9jpVgXN8wS5tYKx53wuRLqvRuqCR"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "invalid credentials"
}
```

### User Authentication/Login (Other Roles)

You can log in as a user by making an HTTP POST call to the following route

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/login
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart or a JSON payload like this

```json
{
    "email":"user@hydra.project",
    "password":"Surprisingly A Good Password"
}
```

You will get a JSON response with user token. You need this user token for making any calls to other routes protected by user ability.

```json
{
    "error": 0,
    "token": "2|u0ZUNlNtXgdUmtQSACRU1KWBKAmcaX8Bkhd2xVIf"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "invalid credentials"
}
```

### List Users (Admin Ability Required)

To list the users, make an `HTTP GET` call to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users
```

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this call.

You will get a JSON response with all users available in your project.

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Hydra Admin",
        "email": "admin@hydra.project"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Test User",
        "email": "test@hydra.project"
    },
]
```

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Update a User (User/Admin Ability Required)

Make an `HTTP PUT` request to the following route to update an existing user. Replace {userId} with actual user id. You must include a Bearer token obtained from User/Admin authentication. A bearer admin token can update any user. A bearer user token can only update the authenticated user by this token.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users/{userId}
```

For example, to update the user with id 3, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/users/3`

**API Payload & Response**

You can include `name` or `email`, or both in a URL Encoded Form Data or JSON payload, just like this

```json
{
    "name":"Captain Cook",
    "email":"captaincook@hydra.project"
}
```

You will receive the updated user if the bearer token is valid.

```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Captain Cook",
    "email": "captaincook@hydra.project",
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "invalid credentials"
}
```

If a bearer user token attempts to update any other user but itself, a 409 error response will be delivered

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "Not authorized"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid `user id`, you will receive a 404 not found error response. For example, when you are trying to delete a non-existing user with id 16, you will receive the following response.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "No query results for model [App\\Models\\User] 16"
}
```

### Delete a User (Admin Ability Required)

To delete an existing user, make a `HTTP DELETE` request to the following route. Replace {userId} with actual user id

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users/{userId}
```

For example to delete the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/users/2`

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this call.

If the request is successful and the bearer token is valid, you will receive a JSON response like this

```json
{
   "error": 0,
   "message": "user deleted"
}
```

You will receive a 401 error response for any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid token.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "invalid credentials"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid `user id`, you will receive a 404 not found error response. For example, you will receive the following response when you try to delete a non-existing user with id 16. 

```json
{
   "error": 1,
   "message": "No query results for model [App\\Models\\User] 16"
}
```

### List Roles (Admin Ability Required)

To list the roles, make an `HTTP GET` call to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/roles
```

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this call.

You will get a JSON response with all the roles available in your project.

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Administrator",
        "slug": "admin"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "User",
        "slug": "user"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Customer",
        "slug": "customer"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Editor",
        "slug": "editor"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "All",
        "slug": "*"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Super Admin",
        "slug": "super-admin"
    }
]
```

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Add a New Role (Admin Ability Required)

To list the roles, make an `HTTP POST` call to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/roles
```

**API Payload & Response**

You need to supply title of the role as `name`, role `slug` in your payload as Multipart Form or JSON data

```json
{
    "name":"Manager",
    "slug":"manager"
}
```

You will get a JSON response with this newly created role for successful execution.

```json
{
    "name": "Manager",
    "slug": "manager",
    "id": 7
}
```

If this role `slug` already exists, you will get a 409 error message like this

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "role already exists"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Update a Role (Admin Ability Required)

To update a role, make an `HTTP PUT` or `HTTP PATCH` request to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/roles/{roleId}
```

For example to update the Customer role, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/roles/3`

**API Payload & Response**

You need to supply title of the role as `name`, and/or role `slug` in your payload as Multipart Form or JSON data

```json
{
    "name":"Product Customer",
    "slug":"product-customer"
}
```

You will get a JSON response with this updated role for successful execution.

```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Product Customer",
    "slug": "product-customer"
}
```

Please note that you cannot change a `super-admin` or `admin` role slug because many API routes in Hydra exclusively require this role to function correctly.

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Delete a Role (Admin Ability Required)

To delete a role, make an `HTTP DELETE` request to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/roles/{roleId}
```

For example, to delete the Customer role, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/roles/3`

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this endpoint.

You will get a JSON response with this updated role for successful execution.

```json
{
    "error": 0,
    "message": "role has been deleted"
}
```

Please note that you cannot delete the `admin` role because many API routes in Hydra exclusively require this role to function correctly.

If you try to delete the admin role, you will receive the following 422 error response.

```json
{
    "error": 1,
    "message": "you cannot delete this role"
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### List Available Roles of a User (Admin Ability Required)

To list all available roles for a user, make an `HTTP GET` request to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call. Replace {userId} with an actual user id

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users/{userId}/roles
```

For example to get all roles assigned to the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/users/2/roles`

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this call.

For successful execution, you will get a JSON response containing the user with all its assigned roles.

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@hydra.project",
    "roles": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "User",
            "slug": "user"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Customer",
            "slug": "customer"
        }
    ]
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Assign a Role to a User (Admin Ability Required)

To assign a role to a user, make an `HTTP POST` request to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call. Replace {userId} with an actual user id

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users/{userId}/roles
```

For example to assign a role to the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/users/2/roles`

**API Payload & Response**

You need to supply `role_id` in your payload as Multipart Form or JSON data

```json
{
    "role_id":3 
}
```

For successful execution, you will get a JSON response containing the user with all its assigned roles.

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@hydra.project",
    "roles": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "User",
            "slug": "user"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Customer",
            "slug": "customer"
        }
    ]
}
```

Notice that the user has a `Roles` array, and this newly assigned role is present in this array.  

Please note that it will have no effect if you assign the same `role` again to a user.

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

### Delete a Role from a User (Admin Ability Required)

To delete a role from a user, make an `HTTP DELETE` request to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call. Replace `{userId}` with an actual user id, and `{role}` with an actual role id

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/users/{userId}/roles/{role}
```

For example, to delete a role with id 3 from the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/users/2/roles/3`

**API Payload & Response**

No payload is required for this call

For successful execution, you will get a JSON response containing the user with all asigned roles to it.

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@hydra.project",
    "roles": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "User",
            "slug": "user"
        },
    ]
}
```

Notice that the user has a `Roles` array, and the role with id 3 is not present in this array.  

For any unsuccessful attempt or wrong token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

## Notes

### Default Admin Username and Password

When you run the database seeders, a default admin user is created with the username '**admin@hydra.project**' and the password '**hydra**'. You can login as this default admin user and use the bearer token on next API calls where admin ability is required. 

When you push your application to production, please remember to change this user's password, email or simply create a new admin user and delete the default one.
### Default Role for New Users

The `user` role is assigned to them when a new user is created. To change this behavior, open your `.env` file and set the value of `DEFAULT_ROLE_SLUG` to any existing `role slug`. New users will have that role by default. For example, if you want your new users to have a `customer` role, set `DEFAULT_ROLE_SLUG=customer` in your `.env` file.

There are five default role slugs in Hydra.
| Role Slug   | Role Name   |
|-------------|-------------|
| admin       | Admin       |
| user        | User        |
| customer    | Customer    |
| editor      | Editor      |
| super-admin | Super Admin |


This ENV variable is configured in in `config/hydra.php` as `default_user_role_slug`, and then used in `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

### Single Session or Multiple Session

Hydra doesn't invalidate the previously issued access tokens when a user authenticates. So, all access tokens, including the newly created one, will remain valid. If you want to change this behavior and delete all previous tokens when a user authenticates, set `DELETE_PREVIOUS_ACCESS_TOKENS_ON_LOGIN` to `true` in your `.env` file. The value of `DELETE_PREVIOUS_ACCESS_TOKENS_ON_LOGIN` is set to `false` by default.

This ENV variable is configured in in `config/hydra.php`, and then used in `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

### Logging

Hydra comes with an excellent logger to log request headers, parameters and response to help debugging and inspecting API calls. All you have to do is wrap the route with 'hydra.log' middleware, as shown below 

```php
Route::post('login', [UserController::class, 'login'])->middleware('hydra.log');
```

or, like this

```php
Route::put('users/{user}', [UserController::class, 'update'])->middleware(['hydra.log', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:admin,super-admin,user']);

```

And then you can see the API call logs in `logs/laravel.log` file.

### Code Formatting

Hydra comes with an excellent code formatter called [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) out of the box, with an excellent configuration preset that you can find in `pint.json`. By default `pint` uses the [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style) for the braces where the braces are placed in a new line after the function name. So we have changed it to [K&R style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style) formatting where the brace stays on the same line of the function name.

To format your code using `laravel pint`, you can run the following command any time from inside your project diretory.

```shell
./vendor/bin/pint
```

And that's all for formatting. To know more, check out laravel pint documentation at [https://github.com/laravel/pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint)

## Tutorial

So you decided to give Hydra a try and create a new protected API endpoint; that's awesome; let's dive in. 

### Create a New API Controller

You can create a normal or a resourceful controller. To keep it simple, I am going with a standard controller. 

```shell
php artisan make:controller MessageController
```

This will create a new file called `app/Http/Controlers/MessageController.php`

### Add a Function

We will add a simple function that will greet the authenticated user. Since this will be protected using Sanctum middleware, only a request with a valid bearer token will be able to access this endpoint. You don't need to worry about anything else.

Open this file `app/Http/Controlers/MessageController.php` and add the following code

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class MessageController extends Controller
{
    public function greet(Request $request){
        $user = $request->user();

        $response = [
            "name" => $user->name,
            "role" => $user->roles()->first()->name //or $user->roles()->first()->slug
        ];

        return $response;

    }
}

```

### Create Protected Routes

Let's create a protected route `http://localhost:8000/api/greet` to use this API

Open your `routes/api.php` file and add the following line at the end.

```php
Route::get('greet', [MessageController::class, 'greet'])->middleware(['auth:sanctum']);
```

Nice! Now we have a route `/api/greet` that is only accessible with a valid bearer token.

### Test Protected Routes

If you have already created a user, you need his accessToken first. You can use the admin user or create a new user and then log in and note their bearer token. To create or authenticate a user, check the documentation in the beginning.

To create a new user, you can place a curl request or use tools like Postman, Insomnia or HTTPie. Here is a quick example using curl.

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/api/users \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---011000010111000001101001' \
  --form 'name=Hydra User' \
  --form email=user@hydra.project \
  --form 'password=Surprisingly A Good Password'
```

Great! Now we have our users. Let's login as this new user using curl (You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or HTTPie)

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/api/login \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "email": "user@hydra.project",
    "password": "Surprisingly A Good Password"
}'
```

Now you have this user's accessToken in the response, as shown below. Note it.

```javascript
{"error":0,"id":2,"token":"5|gbiWdd7yJFYiTIgoK1jK3C7HZJtJUK1PnBIToBLN"}
```

The bearer token for this user is `5|gbiWdd7yJFYiTIgoK1jK3C7HZJtJUK1PnBIToBLN`

Now let's test our protected route. Add this bearer token in your PostMan/Insomnia/HTTPie or Curl call and make a `HTTP GET` request to our newly created protected route `http://localhost:8000/api/greet`. Here's an example call with curl

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8000/api/greet \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer 5|gbiWdd7yJFYiTIgoK1jK3C7HZJtJUK1PnBIToBLN'
```

The response will be something like this.

```javascript
{
    "name": "user@hydra.project",
    "role": "User"
}
```

Great! you have learned how to create your protected API endpoint using Laravel Sanctum and Hydra!

### Protect a Route with Laravel Sanctum's Ability and Abilities Middleware

Let's make our newly created API endpoint even more robust. Say, we want our route to be accessible by only admin users. Remember you added the following line in the `routes/api.php` file just a few minutes ago? Let's change it.

```php
Route::get('greet', [MessageController::class, 'greet'])->middleware(['auth:sanctum']);
```

Change it like this

```php
Route::get('greet', [MessageController::class, 'greet'])->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'ability:admin']);
```

Only an `HTTP GET` call with a valid admin user's access token can access this route.
If you want this route to be accessible by the users with `admin`, **OR** the `user` role, then modify it.

```php
Route::get('greet', [MessageController::class, 'greet'])->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'ability:admin,user']);
```

If you want this route to be accessible by the users with both `user`, **AND** the `customer` role, then modify it.

```php
Route::get('greet', [MessageController::class, 'greet'])->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'abilities:customer,user']);
```

Note that this time we have used the `abilities` keyword instead of `ability`

Great, now you know everything to start creating your next big API project with Laravel & Laravel Sanctum using our powerful boilerplate project called Hydra. Enjoy!
